# Multi-Agent System (Powered by phidata & Groq)

This project demonstrates a specialized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built using the **phidata** framework. It orchestrates a team of agents powered by the high-speed Groq inference engine and the Qwen 32B model to search the web, gather information, and provide comprehensive, well-referenced, and structured answers.
